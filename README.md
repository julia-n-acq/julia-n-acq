I'm a biologist interested in theoretical ecology, evolutionary dynamics, natural history, birds, insects, plants, niche theory and mutualisms. Currently focused on exploring the effects of mutualistic coevolution on communities across local and regional scales. I use JuliaLang for simulation and R for data analysis.

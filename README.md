I'm a biologist interested in theoretical ecology, evolutionary dynamics, natural history, birds, insects, plants, niche theory and mutualisms. Currently I am learning about the effects of mutualistic coevolution on communities in local and regional spatial scales. I am using Julia to simulate the scenarios I am interested, and also using R to analyse data.
